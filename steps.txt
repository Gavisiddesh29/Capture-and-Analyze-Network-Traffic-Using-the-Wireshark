**Wireshark Network Traffic Capture â€“ Short Steps**

1. **Install Wireshark**

   * Download from: [https://www.wireshark.org/download.html](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)

2. **Start Capturing**

   * Open Wireshark.
   * Select your active network interface (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.).
   * Click the "Start Capturing" icon.

3. **Generate Network Traffic**

   * Visit a few websites (e.g., google.com, example.com).

     * `dns` for DNS
     * `tcp` for TCP
     * `icmp` for ping

6. **Identify 3 Protocols**

   * Check the "Protocol" column and note at least three:

     * **TCP**: Seen with SYN and HTTPS (Port 443)
     * **DNS**: Domain lookups using UDP (Port 53)
     * **ICMP**: Ping requests and replies

7. **Export as .pcap**

   * Go to **File > Export Specified Packets**.
   * Save with `.pcap` extension.

8. **Summary**

   * **TCP**: Secure web traffic (HTTPS)
   * **DNS**: Resolves domain names
   * **UDP**: Used by DNS
   * **ICMP**: Ping diagnostics
